# IDTS-110 — Unit Test EN v0.5 expansion

- Catalog owner/approver: DonHV
- Workbook generator/final integrator: DonHV
- Test executor/case-evidence owner: NhanT
- Due: 2026-08-05
- Jira: https://dutassociation.atlassian.net/browse/IDTS-110
- Status: In Progress; evidence package curated, member-owned reruns remain

## Workflow

1. DonHV owns and approves the English-only 188-case catalog.
2. NhanT executes cases and captures sanitized, case-specific evidence.
3. DonHV reviews candidate truth without rewriting execution history.
4. Only accepted results may later enter Unit Test EN v0.5.
5. DonHV alone generates and synchronizes the workbook to the existing Drive ID.

## Current catalog truth

- Catalog: `docs/qa/idts-110-unit-test-catalog.json`
- Frozen catalog baseline: `bc0c47e522ae208384d4b23dda21535dcc683683`
- Cases: 188
- Canonical execution state: 188 `NOT_RUN`
- Workbook/Drive: unchanged

- Held: `UT-ATT-007/008`, pending exact-head acceptance.
- Mapping-only: traceability, not execution PASS.
- Blocked: 13 member-owned BTP/HANA/XSUAA/S3/Job Scheduler integrations.

## Evidence

- `docs/pm/evidence/idts-110/cases/`

No Unit Test VI is created. No command-only, script-only, generated-card-only, shared-account, or unsanitized evidence is accepted as final execution proof.

## 2026-09-04 PR #372 integration boundary

- The review index remains limited to the approved 188-case catalog and links the existing canonical case evidence instead of duplicating generated summary cards.
- Reviewer truth remains 38 accepted candidate, 2 held, 135 mapping-only, and 13 blocked. Mapping-only and blocked rows are not represented as PASS.
- The index is not the official SAP490 workbook and does not change the task's In Progress status, workbook, or Drive artifact.
- Attachment source traces now follow the current metadata-driven `@cap-js/attachments` contract through `@Validation.Maximum` and `@Core.AcceptableMediaTypes`; the removed custom UI constant is no longer referenced.
